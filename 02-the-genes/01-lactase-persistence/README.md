## Key Terms

### Evolution
Evolution is the change in allele frequencies in a population over time.

### Allele
The genetic information of all life is stored in a genetic molecule called the DNA. Stretches of these molecules are called genes. If information transmitted through genes we constant and never changed, life as we know it will lack its diversity. For every gene, there are multiple versions. And these versions are called *Alleles*.

### Lactase Persistence (LCT * P)
This refers to   a feature by which adult individuals continue to produce lactase(the enzyme that can digest lactose).
