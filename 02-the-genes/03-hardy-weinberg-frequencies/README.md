Why are the frequencies expressed in percentages?
====

The Hardy Weinberg model makes a number of assumptions, and one of the key assumptions is that of an infinite population size. In that regard, it doesn’t make sense to talk about absolute numbers because if the population size is infinite then genotype frequencies/allele frequencies expressed as percentages also become infinite. 

Why do we make use of an infinite population size?

If we were to make assumption of a finite population size, then we  would get effects of random chance(which is actually genetic drift). We want to develop a null model which doesn’t have any of the four forces.
