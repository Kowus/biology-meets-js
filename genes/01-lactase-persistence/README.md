## Key Terms

### Evolution
Evolution is the change in allele frequencies in a population over time.

### Allele
The genetic information of all life is stored in a genetic molecule called the DNA. Stretches of these molecules are called *Genes*. If information transmitted through genes were constant and never changed, life as we know it will lack its diversity. For every gene, there are multiple versions. And these versions are called *Alleles*.

### Lactase Persistence (LCT * P)
This refers to   a feature by which adult individuals continue to produce lactase(the enzyme that can digest lactose).

## Forces That Affect Allele Frequencies
* Genetic Drift: The change of Allele frequencies due to random chance.
* Mutation: The  U L T I M A T E  engine of creating diversity in alleles and genes.
* Migration: Anything relating to populations/individuals moving between populations(bringing in new genes/new alleles)
* Natural Selection
