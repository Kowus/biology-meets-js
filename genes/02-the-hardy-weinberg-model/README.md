# The Hardy-Weinberg Principle

## What Is a Null Model
Refers to a process of removing all forces of interest acting on a object to learn how the object will work without any of the forces present.

We need to ensure that none of the four forces mentioned earlier is acting in order to get to the null model. And  this model is called The Hardy Weinberg Model. In other words, what will happen if nothing happened.

At least two alleles are needed for genetic change to occur.
