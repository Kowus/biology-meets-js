Assumptions
==
Hardy Weinberg's principle uses the assumption of an infinite population size.
Genetic drift however makes the assumption of a finite population size. Hardy Weinberg's principle seems quite unrealistic since all populations are finite.

> Population size is typically denoted by the letter **N**.

Chance Effect
===
Since populations are finite, every change in allele frequencies may be attributed to chance, this phenomenon is thus called Chance Effect. Chance Effect is the principal cause of Genetic Drift.

> Chance effect is much stronger in smaller populations.

Example of Chance
===
### Flipping a fair coin

A fair coin has two sides: **heads(_H_)** and **tails(_T_)**.
On any flip, the is a 50% chance that it will show a head, and a 50% chance that it will show a tail. This demonstrates a **5 : 5** ratio. However, with a finite population size, this may not always be the case. Eg. if the coin is flipped 10 times, there could be a **4 : 6** ratio, a **3 : 7** ratio, or even a **10 : 0** ratio.
