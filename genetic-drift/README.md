Assumptions
==
Hardy Weinberg's principle uses the assumption of an infinite population size.
Genetic drift however makes the assumption of a finite population size. Hardy Weinberg's principle seems quite unrealistic since all populations are finite.

> Population size is typically denoted by the letter **N**.

Chance Effect
===
Since populations are finite, every change in allele frequencies may be attributed to chance, this phenomenon is thus called Chance Effect. Chance Effect is the principal cause of Genetic Drift.

> Chance effect is much stronger in smaller populations.

Example of Chance

### Flipping a fair coin

A fair coin has two sides: **heads(_H_)** and **tails(_T_)**.
On any flip, the is a 50% chance that it will show a head, and a 50% chance that it will show a tail. This demonstrates a **5 : 5** ratio. However, with a finite population size, this may not always be the case. Eg. if the coin is flipped 10 times, there could be a **4 : 6** ratio, a **3 : 7** ratio, or even a **10 : 0** ratio.

The main task under genetic drift is figuring out how often a scenario(**ratios**) will be true in a finite population. Also there will be the issue of growth in the popultation being examined.

#### Why Growing Population?
When a fair coin is tossed, heads and tails both have a 50% chance of appearing. However, this may not always be true in a small finite population as it will give many instances of extreme ratios. eg, if the coin is tossed **10** times, there's a higher chance of seeing a **1 : 9** than there would be if the coin was tossed **100** times.

> We will be able to create this perfectly in a binomial distribution because
  flipping a coin is an event that guarantees only two possible outcomes(**H**, **T**), we will be able to calculate the exact probability distribution given the probabilities of the two outcomes and the number of events.
